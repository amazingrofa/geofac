# Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the `geofac` project, organized into the following categories:

*   **[Theory](./theory/)**: Foundational concepts, whitepapers, and core principles of geometric resonance factorization.
*   **[Implementation](./implementation/)**: Code architecture, implementation details, and style guides.
*   **[Validation](./validation/)**: Verification methods, testing, and proof packs.
*   **[Project](./project/)**: Project management, changelogs, and administrative documents. See the original [README](./project/README.md) for more details.
*   **[Archive](./archive/)**: Potentially outdated or experimental work.

All theory and validation narratives adhere to the certification boundary spelled out in `docs/theory/GEOMETRIC_CERTIFICATION_BOUNDARY.md`: geometry ranks candidates; arithmetic (`N mod d`) certifies only the top-ranked list, and logs must capture both phases.

Please explore the directories to find the information you need.
